# ATAS Indicator and Calculation

This repository contains two files, `ATAS_To_Python_v1.cs` and `Calculation.ipynb`, which work together to process trading data from the ATAS platform, export it to a CSV file, and perform calculations on the generated footprint candle.

## ATAS_To_Python_v1.cs

The `ATAS_To_Python_v1.cs` file is a C# indicator designed for the ATAS platform. It retrieves the Bid and Ask volume for each trade and uses this data to create a footprint candle based on a chosen time frame. The generated footprint candle is then exported to a CSV file, which serves as the input for the subsequent calculations performed in the Python file.

**Exported CSV File**: The footprint candle generated by the indicator is saved as a CSV file named `footprint.csv` in the local hard drive.

## Calculation.ipynb

The `Calculation.ipynb` file is a Jupyter Notebook written in Python. It takes the CSV file containing the footprint candle data generated by the `ATAS_To_Python_v1.cs` indicator and performs various calculations on it. The calculation results are then saved in Excel file.

**Input CSV File**: The `footprint.csv` file, generated by the C# indicator, serves as the input for the calculations performed in the Python notebook.

**Output Excel File**: The calculation results are saved as a Excel file named `result.xlsx` in the local hard drive.

## Prerequisites

To use the indicator, export the data to a CSV file, and perform the calculations, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- ATAS platform: Make sure you have the ATAS platform installed and configured on your system.
- Python: Install Python and the necessary dependencies mentioned in the notebook.
- Spreadsheet Software: Ensure that you have a spreadsheet software application, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, to open and view the generated CSV and Excel files.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the ATAS platform and import the `ATAS_To_Python_v1.cs` indicator.
3. Configure the indicator settings, such as the chosen time frame, according to your requirements.
4. Run the ATAS platform with the indicator, and it will generate the footprint candle data.
5. The footprint candle data will be automatically exported to a CSV file named `footprint.csv`. Locate this file in your local hard drive.
6. Open the `Calculation.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.
7. Ensure that you have the required Python dependencies installed (mentioned in the notebook) by using pip or any other package manager.
8. Update the notebook with the correct file path of the `footprint.csv` file generated in step 5.
9. Execute the cells in the notebook to perform the desired calculations on the footprint candle data.
10. The calculation results will be saved as a Excel file named `result.xlsx` in your local hard drive.
